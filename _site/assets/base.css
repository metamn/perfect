/* Base.scss
================================================================================

- A collection of snippets, best practices reusable in every project
- It is my personal boilerplate

*/
/* Metrics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Vertical and horizontal positioning
- This sets the rhythm of the entire page

*/
/* The basic metric for typography and spacing
*/
/* The basic metric for positioning. It is the golden ratio
*/
/* This varies from project to project */
/* The Grid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I employ the 'Fit to screen' principle
- Longer pages are divided into slides, each slide fills completely the screen
- Read more at http://its-csongor.com/manifesto/#ch2

- However this works only on desktop; for mobile classic scrolling must be enabled. Or slides 'removed', 'merged'.

*/
/* Colors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Basic colors to define typographic elements like links and forms
- These can be changed per project.
- However these defaults represent my style
- The basic idea is that pure white and black are not recommended for use, they are too strong

*/
/* The basic color in Kuler */
/* Navigation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- It has a <h3> title to fit the HTML5 Outliner. This is hidden by default
- It always contains a list which can be made displayed inline, or as is
- It is animated by jQuery; On click it will be replaced by a menu symbol

*/
/* Common elements and mixins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/
/* list, inline 
*/
/* Ads a shadow around an element which reacts on hover and when it is active */
/* Makes an element look like a button */
/* Creates a circle */
